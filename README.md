# Self Care Monitoring Gloves (IoT-Based)

## 👨‍⚕️ Project Overview
This project aims to provide a simple, portable health monitoring solution for elderly and differently-abled individuals. The system uses sensors to detect body temperature, pulse rate, and SpO2 levels, displaying the data on an LCD screen and activating a buzzer in case of abnormal readings.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- MLX90614 (Temperature Sensor)
- MAX30102 (Heart rate & SpO2 Sensor)
- 20x4 LCD Display
- Buzzer
- Batteries

## 💡 Features
- Real-time monitoring of health parameters
- LCD display for data visualization
- Buzzer alert system
- Portable and user-friendly

## 📁 File Structure
- `code/self_care_gloves.ino` - Arduino code
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `images/` - PPT snapshot or glove design photo (optional)

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with mobile apps for remote monitoring
- Wireless data transmission to medical professionals
- Advanced alert systems and AI health predictions
